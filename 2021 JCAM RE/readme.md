This folder contains some codes that are useful to reproduce the results in the paper
Scarabel, Diekmann, Vermiglio, Numerical bifurcation analysis of renewal equations via pseudospectral approximation, available at: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05364

The codes are used to perform the numerical bifurcation analysis of the examples in the paper.
The numerical bifurcation is performed using the Matlab package MatCont, available at: https://sourceforge.net/projects/matcont/

The interpoaltion is performed using polint.m contained in the Differentiation Matrix Suite
from Weideman, Reddy 2000: http://appliedmaths.sun.ac.za/~weideman/research/differ.html

For the Matcont continuation, each example consists of two files:
1) PS_example: matlab function containing the definition of the right-hand side of the ODE system obtained through pseudospectral discretization, in the format suitable for the Matcont continuation.
2) MC_example: script for the MatCont continuation of the system defined in "PS_example".

The codes are tested on MATLAB 2020b and MatCont version MatCont7p1.
