# 2016 EJQTDE

This folder contains some codes that are useful to reproduce the results in the paper

[EJQTDE2016] Breda D, Diekmann O, Liessi D, Scarabel F (2016). Numerical bifurcation analysis of a class of nonlinear renewal equations, Electronic Journal of Qualitative Theory of Differential Equations, 65, 1â€“24. https://doi.org/10.14232/ejqtde.2016.1.65 

Each example consists of two files:
PS_example: MATLAB function containing the definition of the right-hand side of the ODE system obtained through pseudospectral discretization, in the format suitable for the MatCont continuation.
MC_example: script for the MatCont continuation of the system defined in "PS_example".

The codes are tested on MATLAB 2014a and MatCont version cl_matcont5p4, 
and on MATLAB 2017a and MatCont version matcont6p6.

## Instruction for the PS_example file
"PS_example" is the system definition file required by MatCont. 
It contains the definition of the right-hand side of the PseudoSpectral discretization of the system under study.

    function dydt = fun_eval(time,state,p1,...,aux,tau,M) 
    
    OUTPUT: evaluation of the rhs of the approximating ODE system
    INPUT: (notation as in Breda et al., SIADS 2016)
    state=(UM,yM,VM) vector of variables, dimension M*d1+(M+1)*d2
    M: discretization index
    aux: auxiliary parameter (e.g. for BP continuation)
    p1,...: model parameters (specific of the model)
    Notice that: model parameters MUST be listed separately
   
The user should modify only the section `PHASE 1: SYSTEM DEFINITION *** to be completed by the user ***`
specifying the desired options and the parameters and functions of the model
   
`PHASE 1` must include the definition of:
`d1, d2`: dimension of the RE and DDE, respectively
`tau_max`: maximal fixed delay for the discretization interval [-tau_max,0]
`FM, GM`: rhs of the RE and DDE, respectively. N.B.: they must be defined as function of x=x(t) (state of the RE in theta_0=0)
Note that, to interpolate a vector W (dimension M+1) at a point theta \neq 0,-tau_max, we use barycentric interpolation: `interpoly(theta,tau_max*UnitNodes,W,BaryWeights)`
   
Options:
`opt_fsolve` is used to invert the algebraic equation coming from RE
`opt_ode` possible options for solving ode systems
   

The user may also modify the section FINAL PHASE in order to treat RE or the DDE only, for speed up reason.
However, this is not necessary.


## Instructions for the MC_example file
"MC_example" is the script containing the instruction for the MatCont continuation.
Continuation and parameter options may be varied in the script.
